                Typically, a teacher interview takes place at the school you're
                applying to. Depending on various factors such as the size of
                the team, the specificity of the role, and the interview stage,
                you might meet with one teacher or staff member (like a
                principal, administrator, or counselor), or even a panel of
                multiple interviewers.

                During interviews, hiring managers seek specific traits and
                characteristics in qualified teaching applicants. Based on
                conversations with talent acquisition teams and HR partners from
                schools in Australia, here are the key characteristics and
                skills they value:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <strong>Teaching Skills:</strong> Hiring managers are
                  interested in how you work with students on both group and
                  individual levels. They often analyze your strategies for
                  managing a classroom, keeping students engaged, and tailoring
                  learning for diverse styles.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Teamwork and Accountability:</strong> Being a great
                  team player means contributing to the overall success of the
                  school. Candidates who meet deadlines and achieve classroom
                  goals are highly valued.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Commitment to Students:</strong> Interviewers want to
                  see genuine care for students. Demonstrate how you attend to
                  the needs of all students, including those with Individualized
                  Education Programs (IEP).
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Data Proficiency:</strong> Effective use of data is
                  crucial in modern education. Provide examples of how you use
                  data to enhance your teaching approach, such as tracking
                  student performance and improving teaching strategies.
                </li>

                <h3>1. Why did you decide to become a teacher?</h3>
                <h4 className="tips">Tip:</h4>
                <p>
                  It may seem like a trivial question, but schools want to know
                  if you are dedicated to enriching the lives of students.
                  Answer honestly with anecdotes and examples.
                </p>
                <h4 className="tips">How to answer:</h4>
                <p>
                  I decided to become a teacher because I wanted to make a
                  difference in students' lives, much like my favourite high
                  school teacher did for me. She made learning exciting and
                  meaningful, which inspired me to pursue teaching so I could
                  share that same passion and impact with my students.
                </p>

                <h3>2. Why do you want to teach in this school?</h3>
                <h4 className="tips">Tip:</h4>
                <p>
                  Research the school’s culture, students, and programs.
                  Demonstrate your fit and how you can contribute.
                </p>
                <h4 className="tips">How to answer:</h4>
                <p>
                  I am drawn to your school because of its strong community
                  focus and commitment to inclusive education. Your innovative
                  programs and dedication to student success align with my
                  teaching philosophy and goals, making it an ideal place for me
                  to contribute and grow as an educator.
                </p>

                <h3>
                  3. How would you handle students you found difficult to teach?
                </h3>
                <h4 className="tips">Tip:</h4>
                <p>
                  Difficulties with students can look like many different
                  things, from falling grades to disrupting lessons.
                  Interviewers want to know how you can help students with the
                  varied obstacles they may face.
                </p>
                <h4 className="tips">How to answer:</h4>
                <p>
                  I approach challenging students by building a strong rapport
                  and understanding their unique needs. I use engaging and
                  varied teaching methods to keep them interested and
                  collaborate with colleagues and parents to provide consistent
                  support and encouragement.
                </p>

                <h3>4. How do you leverage technology in education?</h3>
                <h4 className="tips">Tip:</h4>
                <p>
                  Highlight your tech-savviness and its impact on learning
                  outcomes.
                </p>
                <h4 className="tips">How to answer:</h4>
                <p>
                  I leverage technology by integrating it into my lessons to
                  enhance student engagement and learning outcomes. For example,
                  I use interactive tools like educational apps and online
                  resources to make lessons more dynamic and accessible. I also
                  utilise digital platforms for collaborative projects and
                  virtual field trips, which provide students with unique
                  learning experiences that go beyond the traditional classroom
                  setting.
                </p>

                <h3>5. How do you approach lesson planning?</h3>
                <h4 className="tips">Tip:</h4>
                <p>
                  Detail your planning process, including flexibility and
                  meeting learning goals.
                </p>
                <h4 className="tips">How to answer:</h4>
                <p>
                  My approach to lesson planning involves setting clear
                  objectives, understanding my students’ needs, and
                  incorporating diverse teaching methods. I start by identifying
                  the key concepts and skills to be covered and then design
                  activities that cater to different learning styles. I also
                  include formative assessments to gauge student understanding
                  and adjust my plans as needed to ensure that all students are
                  making progress.
                </p>

                <h3>
                  6. Tell me about a lesson that didn’t go well and what you did
                  about it?
                </h3>
                <h4 className="tips">Tip:</h4>
                <p>Showcase your problem-solving and adaptability.</p>
                <h4 className="tips">How to answer:</h4>
                <p>
                  Once, I planned a science experiment that didn’t go as
                  expected due to technical difficulties with the equipment.
                  Instead of abandoning the lesson, I used it as a teachable
                  moment about problem-solving and adaptability. We discussed
                  what went wrong and brainstormed alternative methods to
                  achieve the experiment’s goals. This experience taught me the
                  importance of flexibility and turning setbacks into learning
                  opportunities.
                </p>

                <h3>
                  7. What behavioural management strategies do you find most
                  effective?
                </h3>
                <h4 className="tips">Tip:</h4>
                <p>
                  Behaviour management is a key component of teaching, and you
                  can’t be a truly brilliant teacher without this. Be specific
                  when answering this kind of interview question.
                </p>
                <h4 className="tips">How to answer:</h4>
                <p>
                  I find that positive reinforcement and clear, consistent
                  expectations are highly effective in managing classroom
                  behaviour. I establish a classroom culture of respect and
                  responsibility from day one and use praise and rewards to
                  reinforce good behaviour. Additionally, I implement a
                  structured routine and provide clear consequences for
                  misbehaviour, ensuring that students understand the importance

                <h4 className="tips">Tip:</h4>
                <p>
                  Today’s inclusive classrooms require that teachers know how to
                  meet each child’s unique educational needs, especially those
                  with disabilities. Prepare a couple of examples of ways you
                  can differentiate instruction to support their particular
                  needs.

                  To meet the needs of a student with an Individualised
                  Education Program (IEP), I closely follow the accommodations
                  and modifications outlined in their plan. I collaborate with
                  special education staff, parents, and other relevant
                  professionals to tailor my teaching strategies and materials
                  to the student’s unique needs. Regular monitoring and
                  adjustments ensure that the student receives the support they
                  need to succeed academically and socially.

                <h3>9. Describe your teaching philosophy</h3>
                <h4 className="tips">Tip:</h4>
                <p>
                  Avoid clichéd, generic responses. Focus on your mission
                  statement.
                </p>
                <h4 className="tips">How to answer:</h4>
                <p>
                  My teaching philosophy centres around creating an inclusive
                  and stimulating learning environment where every student feels
                  valued and motivated to learn. I believe in fostering critical
                  thinking, creativity, and a lifelong love for learning. By
                  using a student-centred approach and differentiated
                  instruction, I aim to meet the diverse needs of my students
                  and empower them to reach their full potential.

                  10. How do you accommodate different learning styles in your
                  classroom?
                </h3>
                <h4 className="tips">Tip:</h4>
                <p>Understand learning styles and provide specific examples.</p>
                <h4 className="tips">How to answer:</h4>
                <p>
                  I accommodate different learning styles by incorporating a
                  variety of teaching methods and activities into my lessons.
                  For visual learners, I use diagrams, videos, and charts. For
                  auditory learners, I include discussions, lectures, and audio
                  recordings. Finally, kinesthetic learners benefit from
                  hands-on activities and movement-based tasks. By offering
                  multiple ways to engage with the material, I ensure that all
                  students can access and understand the content.

                At the end of an interview, you’ll often be asked, “Do you have
                any questions?” This might seem as a way to wrap up, but it’s
                actually one of the most important parts of the interview. By
                asking relevant questions, you can show your enthusiasm for the
                role, grasp a better understanding of your day-to-day duties and
                know what the hiring managers are expecting from candidates.
                Here are the top questions to ask during the interview:
              </p>
              <ol>
                <li>
                  <p>
                    What are some of the challenges you expect the teacher in
                    this position to face?
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    By asking these questions, you'll gain a clearer picture of
                    the job, enabling you to make informed decisions later. For
                    instance, you might discover challenges like overly involved
                    parents, insufficient resources, or the expectation of
                    60-hour work weeks. You can then discuss how you've
                    successfully navigated similar challenges in the past,
                    strengthening your case to the hiring manager.
                  </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>
                    How would you describe your school’s culture? What types of
                    teachers tend to thrive here, and what types don’t do as
                    well?
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Not all school environments suit every teacher. It's crucial
                    to know if this school expects frequent participation in
                    extracurricular activities or allows personal time outside
                    the classroom. Consider whether the environment is
                    collaborative or if it's more independent. Reflect on
                    whether you fit well with this culture to determine if the
                    role suits you.
                  </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>
                    Thinking back to teachers you’ve seen hold this role
                    previously, what differentiated the good ones from the great
                    ones?
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    This is usually the magic question that will impress your
                    interviewers. This question would resonate with the hiring
                    managers as they are interviewing candidates to find someone
                    who excels in their job rather than just doing an average
                    job. By asking this question, you will be able to show your
                    desire to be a great teacher and have a chance to say
                    something about yourself and how you will fit what they are
                    looking for.

                Preparation is key to nail your interview. Once you have
                prepared to answer these teacher interview questions, you’ll
                feel more confident and would be able to answer them well. Don't
                forget to also practise articulating your teaching style. If you
                get stuck during the interview, remember to think back to why
                you decided to become a teacher in the first place.
